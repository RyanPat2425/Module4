        <h1>Ryan Patterson</h1>
        <h2>Graphic Designer</h2>

        <p>Hello, my name is Ryan Patterson. I am a North Carolina-based designer with a strong focus on logo design, digital/print design, and brand design. Design has always played a huge part in my life, starting with illustration as a child. This would eventually lead me to my love for advertising and set me on my journey as a graphic designer.

        My mission as a designer is to provide the highest quality designs that meet both the client’s and my own high expectations. I promise each client that I will deliver the most effective design for their needs and a design that reflects their company’s message. The state of graphic design is ever changing and evolving, and so must the designers in this field. This is something that I find both a welcomed challenge and a rewarding aspect that constantly drives me to grow and evolve myself.</p>
